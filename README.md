# Daitai [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/walerian777/daitai.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/walerian777/daitai)

Daitai (代替, Japanese for "alternative") is a functional library for Ruby language.

#### Why is it different?
* Encourages **Haskell's style** of writing functions - the object you work on is the last parameter, so you can compose a sequence of operations on this object.
* Provides **curried** functions.
* Favors **immutability**.
* Eliminates **side effects**.



## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'daitai'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install daitai
```
